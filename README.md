# Chrono Count

This project is an iOS app called Chrono Count, which I developed in my sophomore year of high school. For more information, see my website [here][other projects]. This is very old code, and I do not know if it still works. However, if you are interested in this project, please feel free to contact me at [radon.rosborough@gmail.com][email] and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.
