# Chrono Count

This project is an iOS app called Chrono Count, which I developed in
my sophomore year of high school. For more information, see my website
[here][other projects]. This is very old code, and I do not know if it
still works. However, if you are interested in this project, please
feel free to contact me at [contact+chrono-count@radian.codes][email]
and I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.

The website [apprisingsoftware.com][old website] used to contain
information about Chrono Count. Since Chrono Count is no longer
available for download from the App Store, I took this website down.
You can view its contents in the Website subdirectory of this project.
