                <p style="padding-top: 0pt; " class="paragraph_style">So what exactly is a timeset?<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">A timeset is a list of rules about which sections of time to exclude or include from a countdown or countup. While there are infinite possibilities for rules that can be created, a timeset is simply a list of these. Since each rule specifies a regular time interval as well as “exclude” or “include,” the timeset is like a set of instructions to the app.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">An example of a timeset<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Say a countdown has been created to measure the amount of time between now and Christmas. A timeset with three rules has been applied to this countdown:<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <ol>
                  <li style="line-height: 20px; padding-left: 17px; text-indent: -17px; " class="full-width" value="1">
                    <p style="text-indent: -17px; " class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="font-size: 15px; " class="Bullet">1.</span><span style="width: 4px; " class="inline-block"></span>Exclude weekends<br /></p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="line-height: 20px; padding-left: 17px; text-indent: -17px; " class="full-width" value="2">
                    <p style="text-indent: -17px; " class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="font-size: 15px; " class="Bullet">2.</span><span style="width: 4px; " class="inline-block"></span>Exclude December 23 through January 6<br /></p>
                  </li>
                  <li style="line-height: 20px; padding-left: 17px; text-indent: -17px; " class="full-width" value="3">
                    <p style="text-indent: -17px; " class="paragraph_style_1"><span style="font-size: 15px; " class="Bullet">3.</span><span style="width: 4px; " class="inline-block"></span>Exclude 3:30 PM through 8:00 AM<br /></p>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">This timeset might represent someone’s school schedule (in other words, this countdown will show the amount of time left in school until Christmas), although in practice a number of more complex rules could be added to refine the schedule. When the app processes this countdown, it first finds the actual time interval between the current time and Christmas. Then, any time that lies on a weekend in this interval is removed, making the time remaining smaller. The same is done with the second interval, although the part of the rule that specifies December 26 to January 6 doesn’t actually affect the time shown on the countdown. Note that the app automatically detects when a range of days or hours should loop around the year or day instead of being only in one year or day. Finally, more time is excluded by the third rule such that the only time remaining is between 8:00 AM and 3:30 PM (because all the other time in the day was excluded, wrapping around because the first time came <span class="style_1">after</span> the second one). The time actually displayed is that remaining after each of these rules are applied in order.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">Rules: what are they and what can they do?<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <div class="paragraph Body">Rules can be created for a variety of purposes. Each rule is composed of a one or more options from the New <div style="height: 510px; width: 262px;  clear: left; float: left; height: 510px; margin: 6px 6px 6px 0px; position: relative; width: 262px; " class="tinyText style_SkipStroke inline-block stroke_0"><img src="Tutorial_files/screenshot2.png" alt="" style="border: none; height: 510px; width: 263px; " /></div>Rule screen. Each option represents a particular range of time that will repeat infinitely as long as its condition is met. For instance, the Weekends constraint represents the entirety of Saturday and Sunday every week that is covered by the countdown. If you were to create a rule with only the Weekends option and the default “Exclude” (which can be switched at the top of the screen), then this is exactly what it would do - exclude all weekends in any countdown this timeset is applied to. There are a multitude of different options available, representing time ranges from years to hours.<br /></div>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">However, a rule is not limited to only one option; for instance, what if you are making a timeset for your work schedule, but get out an hour earlier on Fridays? The rule for this would be, for instance, “Exclude 4:00 PM through 5:00 PM during Friday.” You can create it by selecting the “range of time” option for 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM and then selecting the “day of week” option for Friday, without creating the rule in between. If you select multiple options, each representing a specific range of time, the only time that will be affected by the timeset is the time that satisfies all of the options. For instance, with this rule, time will be excluded by this rule that is from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM <span class="style_1">and</span> on a Friday. You can expand this to any two (or more) rules selected from different categories - for instance, excluding February 2014: specific year and specific month combined.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">It is important to note that one rule with two options is not the same as two rules, each with one option. For instance, the timeset...<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Exclude Friday<br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Exclude the 13th<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">... will exclude all Fridays, and exclude the 13th day in every month. However, a timeset with the single two-option rule...<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">Exclude Friday the 13th (“day of week” Friday + “specific day in month” 13th)<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">... will exclude only time that is on both a Friday and the 13th - i.e., all Friday the 13th’s.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">How to use timesets yourself<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">In the main screen of the app, tap the Timesets icon on the right-hand side of the bar. On the Timesets screen, tap the + button to create a new timeset and the Edit List button to delete and reorder already existing timesets. Once you have created a timeset, you may tap on it while <span class="style_1">not</span> in “Edit List” mode to change its constraints. Any countdowns or countups using the timeset will automatically update themselves when you have finished editing.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="Body">When creating a timeset, you will notice several options available. Tap Add Rule to add rules, Clear to remove all rules from the timeset being created (a timeset being created will be autosaved unless cleared), Copy to replace the rules currently listed with those from another timeset already created (for instance, if you wish to have two timesets that are only slightly different, but don’t want to recreate all the rules from the first one), and Create Timeset to add the timeset to the list. Don’t worry, you can always go back to modify any of your timesets.<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p class="paragraph_style">I still don’t understand...<br /></p>
                <p class="Body"><br /></p>
                <p style="padding-bottom: 0pt; " class="Body">You can always use Chrono Count as a countdown and countup app with full functionality without timesets.
